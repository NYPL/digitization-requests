            <td>Umesika was a publication of the Afro-American Employees Association of the New York Times, circulated internally and documenting the experiences of the Times' Black employees.  Created during the early 1970s, a period known for its exploration of Black identity and activism, Umesika (Swahili for "have you heard") represents Black voices at a major news and New York City institution: reflecting, empowering, and challenging.  Little seems to be written about this title, and the Library's New York Times Company records holds five of its issues.  If digitized, this project has great potential for collaborative outreach with current staff at the New York Times.</td>

Though Umesika was a publication created by the Afro-American Employees Association of The Times, it is unclear whether or not the publication in question, or content created by individual contributors (including writers, photographers, illustrators, etc.) would be covered by this agreement. Further checks must be made for any copyright notices (works published before 1978 without a proper notice of copyright are in the public domain), as well as creator and author copyright notices/attributions, with the possibility open for having to clear some Rights and obtain permissions in order for material to be displayed publicly on Digital Collections.

Other considerations: Right of Publicity for any photographs/individuals depicted in the publication (which would permit non-commercial uses only); See also Metadata section below: When NYTCR finding aid is re-imported into MMS, the existing collection-level Rights profile, and any item-level Rights profiles for previously digitized material, must be recreated, with Deed of Gift PDF reattached to the collection.

As per the finding aid there is currently an item-level record for Umesika in the NYTCR collection in MMS.

Yes

If yes, can each item, when considered as a complete object, be captured in full by an overhead camera without the use of cradles and/or other supports or weights on the standard imaging table (keep in mind: most bound materials will require the use of a cradle or other similar props for capture)? 
Yes; However the DIU has stated that the material may be better digitized by flatbed scanning, if the eventual use of OCR is planned. (OCR is not currently available for DC); A materials review is planned by DIU in the coming days to decide on the best method of digitizing material.

If yes to both questions, please provide the following information: What types of items are you requesting digitization for? (ex: books, flat sheets, 3D objects, slides/negatives, etc.) Flat sheets (staples to be removed before digitization) 

What are your requested items made of? (ex: paper, parchment, textile, mixed media, photographic film, etc.) Paper (approx. 50 pages)

How much of the item should be captured in each image and what is the approximate size of that physical area? All (standard paper size, up to  11x17”)
