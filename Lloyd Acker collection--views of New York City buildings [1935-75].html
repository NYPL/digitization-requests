            <td>"Lloyd Acker was a real estate photographer, whose utilitarian shots of buildings around NY City capture both exterior and interior shots of many buildings that would have been overlooked by many professional photographers. The collection is particularly useful for building historians, architects, preservationists, local and family historians. Digitizing this collection, which was microfilmed after the nitrate negatives were deemed unstable, would be an enormous addition to our already great collection of NYC building and street photography and would make the collection widely and easily accessible for the first time ever. The fact that the collection is indexed by addresses with dates presumes the ready integration into the SpaceTime directory."

Roughly 50 images have already been digitized through public orders; therefore there is already an existing collection in MMS, linked to the public catalog record. It would make sense to digitize the full collection.  </td>

It appears to be present in card index, but for efficienct reconciliation between the microfilmed card index and images, it would be better to work from a structured OCR of the index rather than doing manual transcription. At minimim, if the primary reason for digitization is to geocode the images, we would want images at item-level (rather than capture-level grouped into items by Group or Series). We would need to restructure the existing collection intellectually (by Group, then Series) and images initially uploaded to MMS by Group. Once in MMS, a DCA and available MSU staff can relocate images to groups by series (or can coordinate with DIU to organize before upload). Titles can reflect group and series number until further effort is available for including street name titles. This "minimal" approach would take a level 4 of effort. OCR and addition of street addresses would be level 5. </p>
